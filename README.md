My name is Chris Troutner and I am an active developer in the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) cryptocurency space. I spent two years developer the [rest.bitcoin.com](https://rest.bitcoin.com) REST API for interacting with the BCH blockchain, and the [BITBOX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-sdk) JavaScript library for creating BCH blockchain-based apps.

In March 2020, I left Bitcoin.com and found the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://PSFoundation.cash). The PSF is attempted to become the first [decentralized autonomous organization DAO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) on the Bitcoin Cash network. PSF is a community of JavaScript developers exploring the intersection of open source, Bitcoin Cash and tokens, and the grey market. We build tools around cryptocurrency, tokens, privacy, and group communication.

[FullStack.cash](https://FullStack.cash) is the flagship product for the PSF. It's a cloud-based Blockchain-as-a-service business. The organization maintains the [bch-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api) REST API, and provides paid subscription access to the cloud infrastructure that powers it. It also maintains the [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) JavaScript library. These tools can be used to build blockchain apps like [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash).

[Wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash) is based on the open source [bch-wallet-starter](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-starter) Gatsby Starter. We encourage businesses that want to build BCH Blockchain apps to build off of our web wallet and plugins.

I'm always available to help developers explore the Bitcoin Cash space. You can find me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/christroutner), [Memo.cash](https://memo.cash/profile/1NpYaazpQ26KrMTeFf66zVKy6x9KzcLgTA), and you can reach me on [Telegram](https://t.me/bch_js_toolkit).

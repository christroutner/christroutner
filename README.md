My name is Chris Troutner and I am an active developer in the cryptocurency space. I primarily work on Bitcoin Cash (BCH), but I have dabbled with smart contract programming on Ethereum (ETH) and Avalanche (AVAX). I've also contributed code to the eCash (XEC) and Dash blockchains. I've also worked for decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) such as [ShapeShift](https://shapeshift.com/) and [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/).

I spent two years (2018-2020) at [Bitcoin.com](https://bitcoin.com) developing the [BITBOX](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bitbox-sdk) JavaScript library for creating BCH blockchain-based apps. This was a combination of JS library and REST API for interacting with the BCH blockchain. At it's peak, it was serving over 8 million requests per day.

In March 2020, I left Bitcoin.com and founded the [Permissionless Software Foundation](https://PSFoundation.cash). The PSF is attempting to become the first [decentralized autonomous organization (DAO)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decentralized_autonomous_organization) on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain. PSF is a community of JavaScript developers exploring the intersection of open source, Bitcoin Cash and tokens, and the grey market. We build tools around cryptocurrency, tokens, privacy, and group communication.

[FullStack.cash](https://FullStack.cash) is the flagship product for the PSF. It's a cloud-based Blockchain-as-a-service subscription service. I maintain the [bch-api](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-api) REST API, which provides paid subscription access to the cloud infrastructure that powers blockchain-based tooling. I also maintain the [bch-js](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-js) and [minimal-slp-wallet](https://www.npmjs.com/package/minimal-slp-wallet) JavaScript libraries. These tools can be used to build blockchain apps like [wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash).

[Wallet.fullstack.cash](https://wallet.fullstack.cash) is based on the open source [bch-wallet-web3-android](https://github.com/Permissionless-Software-Foundation/bch-wallet-web3-android) React app. It also leverages the [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/) framework to compile it into an Android and iOS app. We encourage businesses that want to build BCH Blockchain apps to fork and whitelabel our 100% open source, MIT-licensed web wallet and plugins.

Over the course of 2021 and 2022, I created additional blockchain-based infrastrustructure such as the pay-to-write databse ([P2WDB](https://p2wdb.com)), a [decentralized exchange](https://dex.fullstack.cash) spanning three different blockchains, and the [Cash Stack](https://cashstack.info). I split my time between freelance work and improving this open source infrastructure.

I'm always available to help developers explore the intersection of open source and cryptocurrency.
